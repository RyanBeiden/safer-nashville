# A Safer Nashville

The City of Nashville has created the following plan to get the city back to work.
The hard truth is that our city will be living with COVID-19 until there is an effective vaccine for the virus.
Living with COVID-19 means returning to work with COVID-19.
We must proceed carefully to ensure we do not create a surge that will send us all back home.
Nashvilleâ€™s economy will open in four phases. We will only move to the next phase if there is positive
improvement/stability in the metrics for 14 days.
